# expense-calculator

This is a simple expense calculator built in React.js for my personal portfolio

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a simple expense calculator that can be built upon in the future for my personal portfolio.
I wanted to create a simple application that would be simple to build, in terms of MVP, but could be refactored and improved as my skills as a developer improve.
The application will display a form upon load to take in user data. By default, the only values that are set are the number of hours worked per week (40 hrs)
and number of people that are splitting the expenses (1).

### Use

This calculator is used to estimate the post-tax hourly earnings required to pay bills based on the user's monthly expenses.

### Technologies

- React.js
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BootStrap

### Future Improvements (TODO)

- Field validation
- Integrate a button on the Results page that will allow the user to make changes to thier expenses
- The ability to add labels to each expense
- Iterating through the array of totals on the Results page rather than hard coding them
- The ability to select what kind of results you would like (ex. Only hourly cost per person)
- Calculate percentage of income that is used for living expenses based on the user's hourly or salaried income.
