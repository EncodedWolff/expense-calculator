# expense-calculator
This is a simple expense calculator built in React.js for my personal portfolio


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build a simple expense calculator that can be built upon in the future for my personal portfolio.
I wanted to create a simple application that would be simple to build, in terms of MVP, but could be refactored and improved as my skills as a developer improve.
The application will display a form upon load to take in user data. By default, the only values that are set are the number of hours worked per week (40 hrs)
and number of people that are splitting the expenses (1).

### Use
This calculator is used to estimate the post-tax hourly earnings required to pay bills based on the user's monthly expenses.

### Technologies
 - React.js
 - JavaScript
 - CSS
 - BootStrap
